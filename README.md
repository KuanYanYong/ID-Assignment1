this is a website for a cruise company called "TravelTheSea"
it provides the neccessary information such as the different destinations, prices, deals offered by the company and a contact section for the customer to feedback. 

for purchase.html, i realised that the assignment did not require us to make an eCommerce platform but a website that showcase products, but i decided to keep it.
