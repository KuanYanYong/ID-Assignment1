The website provides the neccessary information such as the different destinations, prices, deals offered by the company and a contact section for the customer to feedback. 
For the home page "index.html" I wanted the slogan of the company to be the first thing they see when visiting. There are 2 primary call-to-action (CTA) that they will see and that is the "Visit Website" and "Watch a video". Clicking the first CTA would bring them to the Royal Carribean website while clicking the second CTA would bring them to a Youtube AD for cruises.

for purchase.html, i realised that the assignment did not require us to make an eCommerce platform but a website that showcase products, but i decided to keep it.
